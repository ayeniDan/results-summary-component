## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I used background gradients for the first time. though I had help remembering the sytax from w3schools

### Continued development

I need to work on my responsive design

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.org) - This helped me to look around properties and syntax for background gradient and other html and css properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
